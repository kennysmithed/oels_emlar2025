# oels_emlar2025
Slides and code for Kenny Smith's tutorial at [Experimental Methods in
Language Research](https://emlar.wp.hum.uu.nl), April 2025. 

The slides (oels_emlar2025.pptx and oels_emlar2025.pdf) contain links to other useful resources - the main one if you want much more detail is the link to [my Online Experiments course page](https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2024/) at Edinburgh.

If you want to run the demo experiments, download the entire folder to your computer, then open the html file in a web browser. E.g. if you want to try out the Gomez & Gerken demo, save the entire gomez_gerken_1999 folder somewhere (it contains an html file, a javascript file, and a folder of sound stimuli) then open gg99.html in a web browser (in Chrome it's File...Open File) and it should run. This will be running the experiment on your local computer so you can play around - obviously for real data collection you will need to put the experiment on a server and direct participants to a URL for the experiment, see my course pages for detailed instructions on how this can be done!

NB Word stimuli in the Martin & White (2021) example were provided by Alex Martin and can also be found on his personal website and OSF page.

These are developed from [a 2021 workshop I did with Shira Tal](https://github.com/kennysmithed/evwall_talsmith) - basically slightly different slides and an update of the example experiments to jsPsych7.3, plus I added an image-audio-button-response plugin for the Martin & White (2021) demo experiment.
